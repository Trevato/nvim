# trevato's neovim config

This is my neovim config that was originally based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

I have added a few things that I find very helpful:

- [avante](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim): AI plugin
- JS/TS linting and formatting
- other small things that I'll add here if I think of them
